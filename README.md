# Reversi-with-greedy-bot

The Reversi board game is a two-player strategy game played on a board with 64 squares, where each player has a set of discs that are either black or white. The objective of the game is to have the majority of your discs on the board at the end of the game. In this implementation of the game, players can either play against each other or against a computer opponent. If playing against the computer, it uses a greedy algorithm to make its moves. This algorithm evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that results in the greatest immediate gain in disc count.


## Key features

 - The current state of the game board can be saved in a file and be loaded.
 - The ability to switch between bot mode and player mode at any time.
 - Every possible move is highlighted to give a better perception of the next moves.
